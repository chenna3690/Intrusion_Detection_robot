What is an Intrusion Detection Robot?
An Intrusion Detection Robot is an autonomous or semi-autonomous robotic system designed to detect unauthorized access or presence in a restricted area using sensors and embedded technology. It's part of modern smart security systems and can monitor, detect, alert, and respond to security breaches.

ü§ñ Key Components of an Intrusion Detection Robot:
Motion Sensor (PIR Sensor)

Detects human movement by sensing infrared heat.

Ultrasonic Sensor

Measures distance to detect nearby obstacles or movement.

ESP32 or Microcontroller

Processes sensor data and controls outputs like buzzer, relay, or web server.

Buzzer or Alarm System

Alerts users when intrusion is detected.

Relay Module

Can trigger external devices like lights, sirens, or cameras.

Camera (optional)

Captures photos/video of the intruder (ESP32-CAM is commonly used).

Web Server / IoT Dashboard

Displays sensor readings in real-time

Sends alerts to the user

Allows remote control and monitoring via HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface

üß† How It Works (Basic Flow):
Robot continuously monitors surroundings using PIR and ultrasonic sensors.

If motion is detected or someone comes too close:

Robot sounds an alarm using a buzzer.

Optionally, turns on a light or records via camera.

Sends data to a web dashboard hosted on ESP32.

User accesses the live data via browser on phone/laptop (no need for internet if SoftAP is used).

üè† Applications:
Home and office security

Industrial zone surveillance

Military base monitoring

Smart campus security systems

Night watch automation in buildings
